# Home Lab Monitoring

## Overview

A complete Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) monitoring stack that spins up in seconds using Docker Compose. Captures high-resolution system metrics, retains historical data with optimized retention policies, and visualizes it all in a Grafana dashboard. Acts as an extention to my [Smart Home Dashboard](https://github.com/joonaMakiKorte/smarthome) -project for monitoring the server hardware.
